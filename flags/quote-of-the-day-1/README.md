## Quote of the Day 1

__Description__

```
A certain distinguished captain is fond of speaking words of wisdom. As such,
he provides a quote-of-the-day service so his followers can be touched by his
brilliance every day. Not everyone has access though; it will only let you in
if you know the password!

You managed to convince a sailor to steal the qotd binary and send it to you.
However, the quote in the binary is out of date. Analyze the binary, retrieve
today's quote from the server, and give us its md5 hash!
