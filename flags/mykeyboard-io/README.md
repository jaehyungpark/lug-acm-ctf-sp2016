## MyKeyboard.io

__Description__

```
MyKeyboard.io is the hot new start-up in town, inspired by a series of popular
posts in a certain computer science Facebook group. Being in closed beta, it
will only allow users with special invite codes to sign up. But like most
hackathon-project-turned-start-ups, MyKeyboard.io doesn't seem to pay much
attention to the security of their flashy website.
