## HerpDerp protocol

__Description__

```
HerpDerp Co distrusts SSL, and instead likes to use its own proprietary
datagram protocol (designed by an intern) for securely communicating amongst
its services. While sniffing traffic in a coffee shop, you managed to capture a
few packets from a client talking to a HerpDerp Co server.

You suspect that there are probably vulnerabilities in the protocol. Decrypt
the messages to find the flag.

(NOTE: the flag for this problem is guaranteed to be less than 8 characters)
