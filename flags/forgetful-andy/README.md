## Forgetful Andy

__Description__

```
Andy has forgotten his password - the system administrators can reset it, but
he has a bad habit of password reuse, and has asked them to try to retreive it
from /etc/shadow so he can recover his myspace. This being a small company, the
administrators decided to help him.
```

__Hint__

```
Andy's myspace account wasn't very secure - even sha-512 can't help him.
```

__Flag__

```
